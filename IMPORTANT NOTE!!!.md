When you place project's images online using services like: Imgur & ImgBB, 
you MUST!!! add image's extension like: png, jpg at the end of the link
that those services will provide for you, like for example:

 <img src="https://imgur.com/qKkUjpt" alt="">


So in order for this image to be displayed you MUST!!! add its extension: png

 <img src="https://imgur.com/qKkUjpt.png" alt="">

otherwise it will not work!!!
